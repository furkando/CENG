In the first part of the term project we are given a network, an unreliable one, which consists 5 hosts:\\
    a source node\\
    a broker node\\
    2 router nodes\\
    and a destination node\\

Between these nodes we are given 5 nodes with configurations(IPs etc.). And we are asked to implement TCP connection between source and broker node, UDP connection between broker, router and destination nodes. To implement this configurations to given nodes we have used Python's socket module and embedded the scripts into nodes which works as given specifications. After configuring network and importing into GENI platform, we have send 100 messages to make our experiment more real-like and we have recorded the end-to-end delay (see section XX to see the calculation of end-to-end delay). Then we have examined the outputs.
Detailed explanation of how codes work are described in ReadMe section and also in comments in that, please check it to understand rest of the report.
