In the first part of the term project we are asked to send our messages over unreliable network with TCP and UDP based socket application to the routers then catch the message from destination node. Briefly, send our message over TCP stream and convert it to UDP Datagram and vice versa. In this part, we have tested our scripts on Virtual Machines via GENI Platform. We have used NTP to synchronize the time between VMs. After that we have examined the end-to-end delay for the packets that we sent from source to destination.
