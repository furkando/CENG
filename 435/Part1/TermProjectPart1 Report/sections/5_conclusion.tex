After we collect the data, we examined the difference between TCP and UDP connection To do that, we calculate time in broker and one of router. While some packets travel faster in UDP, some don't. In theory, UDP is faster because error recovery is not attempted. It is a "best effort" protocol and TCP does error checking and error recovery. Erroneous packets are re-transmitted from the source to the destination. The contradiction may cause, we are sending small sized packets as our packets arrive in msecs or maybe caused from devices. 

To conclude, in this project we learned how to create sockets in Python and send packets from one node to another over TCP and UDP and how to calculate end-to-end delay. We also have calculated the confidence interval, which helps us to use results easily with allowable error rate.
The network delays are important especially in systems which operates simultaneously to overcome the problems caused by delays in network. Delays are the important factors to be calculated and design the system according to that for computer engineers especially working on huge systems.
