iWith the introduction of revision 1 and the sparse superblock feature in Ext2, only specific block groups contain copies of the superblock and block group descriptor table. All block groups still contain the block bitmap, inode bitmap, inode table, and data blocks. The shadow copies of the superblock can be located in block groups 0, 1 and powers of 3, 5 and 7.
